# convertUSRT
This program converts YouTube auto-generated transcriptions (.srt files),
so that transcription will be shown in player like a one-liner solution instead of two lines.
This can be especially usefull for big monitors. This also fixes YouTube "feature"
when auto-generated transcription is displayed without a natural or logical sequence.
Usage: place `convertUSRT.exe` in the same folder where .srt files located. Run it once.
A processed files will be located in the "converted" folder.
