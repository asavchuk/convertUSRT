# convertUSRT
This programm converts U-tube auto-generated transcriptions (.srt files),
so that transcription will be shown in player like a one-liner solution instead of two lines.
This can be especially usefull for big monitors. This also removes U-tube "feature"
when auto-generated transcription shows in not straightforward order.
Usage: place `convertUSRT.exe` in the same folder where .srt files located. Run it once.
A processed files will be located in the "converted" folder.
